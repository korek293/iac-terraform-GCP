# Problem to Be Solved in This Lab
This lab shows you how to use Terraform to create infrastructure in GCP including an instance group, VPC, subnetworks, firewall rules with network tags, and service accounts. Each instance will report its data to a specified Cloud Storage bucket on startup. This task is binding to real production needs – for instance, developers could request instances with the ability to write debug information to a Cloud Storage bucket.

 
### Explanation of the Solution
You will use Terraform with the GCP provider to create 2 separate Terraform configurations:
 1) Base configuration
 2) Compute configuration
After you’ve created the configuration, we will work on its optimization like using a data-driven approach and creating modules.


## PRE-REQUISITES
1. Fork current repository. A fork is a copy of a project and this allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
2. All actions should be done under your fork and Terraform gets it context from your local clone working directory: 
    - Prepare GCP environment: create a GCP project, create a service account, grant `Project Owner` permissions and generate credentials in the JSON format.
    - Change current directory to `/tf-epam-lab/base` folder and create `root.tf` file. 
    - Add a `terraform {}`empty block to this file. Create a GCP provider block inside `root.tf` file with the following attributes: 
        - `project = jsondecode(file("~/.gcp/credentials.json"))["project_id"]`
        - `credentials = file("~/.gcp/credentials.json")`.

**Hint**: Add your GCP credentials to the `~/.gcp/credentials.json` file. Refer to [this](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started) document for details.

Run `terraform init` to initialize your configuration. 
Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your configuration is valid and fits to a canonical format and style. Do this each time before applying your changes.
Run `terraform plan` to ensure that there are no changes.

Please use **underscore** Terraform resources naming, e.g. `my_resource` instead of `my-resource`.

3. Change current directory  to `~/tf-epam-lab/compute` and repeat the steps in [2].

You are ready for the lab!

# Creating Infrastructure

## TASK 1 - Creating VPC
Change current directory  to `~/tf-epam-lab/base`

Create a network stack for your infrastructure:

-	**VPC**: `name={StudentName}-{StudentSurname}-01-vpc`, `auto_create_subnetworks=false`
-	**Public subnetworks**:
    - `name={StudentName}-{StudentSurname}-01-subnetwork-central`, `cidr=10.10.1.0/24`, `region=us-central1`)
    - `name={StudentName}-{StudentSurname}-01-subnetwork-east`, `cidr=10.10.3.0/24`, `region=us-east1`)

**Hint**: A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use it multiple times within a module without repeating it. 

Store all resources from this task in the `network.tf` file.
Store all locals in `locals.tf`.

Run `terraform validate`  and `terraform fmt` to check if your configuration is valid and fits to a canonical format and style. Do this each time before applying your changes.

## TASK 9 - Use data discovery
**Mandatory**: Please do not proceed to TASKS  9-14 until your have finished previous tasks. Once completed please remove .gitlab-ci.yml from your repository and merge this change. This will disable the proctor checks. Proctor cannot access to the resources in non-local state therefore it should be disabled.

Learn about [terraform data sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/data-sources/index.html) and [querying terraform data sources](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/data-sources?in=terraform/configuration-language&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_BLOG&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE).

In this task we are going to use a data driven approach instead to use remote state data source.

#### base configuration
Change current directory to `~/tf-epam-lab/base`

Refine your configuration :
- Use a data source to request an account ID,
- Use a data source to request a region operate under.

Store all resources from this task in the `data.tf` file.

Refer to this data sources in your in case it works.

#### compute configuration
Change the current directory to `~/tf-epam-lab/compute`

Refine your configuration:

- Use a data source to request resource group created in the `~/tf-epam-lab/base` and assign it to your resources.
- Following data sources are required: `vpc_id`, `subnetworks_ids`[set of strings], `project_metadata_id`, `bucket_id`. As for the `service_account_email` - it's contains simple text and could be strictly defined with locals without calling data sources.

Hint: These data sources should replace remote state outputs, therefore you can delete `data "terraform_remote_state" "base"` resource from your current state and the `outputs.tf` file from the `base` configuration. **Don't forget to replace references with a new data sources.**
Hint: run `terraform refresh` command under `base` configuration to reflect changes.

Store all resources from this task in the `data.tf` file.

Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your configuration is valid and fits to a canonical format and style. Do this each time before applying your changes.
Run `terraform plan` to see your changes. Also you can use `terraform refresh`.
If applicable all resources should be defined with the provider alias.

Apply your changes when ready.

# Working with Terraform state

In this section, we will delve into Terraform state management and Terraform backends. A backend serves as the repository where Terraform  stores its state files. The default backend is local, meaning that it stores the state file on your local disk. To enable effective collaboration with your colleagues, you should consider utilizing a [remote backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote).

Switching the backend is a straightforward process accomplished by [re-initializing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/init#backend-initialization) with Terraform.

It's crucial to highlight an important note regarding importing or moving resources between states in the upcoming tasks. Typically, there are several methods for transferring resources between two states:

 1)   Employing the built-in `terraform state mv` command.
 2)   Directly editing state files.
 3)   Using the `terraform import` command.

When migrating a resource block (your code) between configurations, you must simultaneously transfer the data between states. Additionally, there is an [experimantal feature](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration) available for auto-generating configuration during the import process. However, this is beyond the scope of our current training.

Please note that the `terraform state mv` [1] command exclusively functions with local states. Therefore, if you opt for this method, ensure that you migrate your resources before transitioning to a remote state.

Alternatively, you can copy state files locally and relocate resources using either `terraform state mv`` or inline editing[2]. However, please be aware that inline editing is not a secure option, and you would need to modify the 'serial' counter each time you make changes in the state file.

Finally, you have the option to import an existing resource into a new state using the `terraform state import resource.name resource.id` command[3] and remove it from the old state with `terraform state rm resource.name`.

Any of these options will serve the purpose, but for educational purposes, we have opted for the simplest approach using `terraform state mv` command.


## TASK 10 - Move resources

Learn about [terraform state mv](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/state/mv.html) command

You are going to move previously created resource (Cloud Storage Bucket) from `base` to `compute` state.
Hint: Keep in mind that there are 3 instances: GCP resource, Terraform state file which store some state of that resource, and Terraform configuration which describe resource. "Move resource" is moving it between states. Moreover to make it work you should delete said resource from source configuration and add it to the destination configuration (this action is not automated).

- Move the created project metadata resource from the `base` state to the `compute` using `terraform state mv` command.
- Update both configurations according to this move.
- Run `terraform plan` on both configurations and observe the changes. Hint: there should not be any changes detected (no resource creation or deletion in case of correct resource move).

Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your configuration is valid and fits to a canonical format and style.

### Definition of DONE:

- Terraform moved resources with no errors
- GCP resources are NOT changed (check GCP Console)


## TASK 11 - Move state to Cloud Storage Bucket

Hint: Create a Cloud Storage Bucket(`name=epam-gcp-tf-state-${random_string}`) as a pre-requirement for this task. Please create the resource by a hands in GCP console. That resource will be out of our IaC approach as it will never be recreated.

Learn about [terraform backend in Cloud Storage Bucket](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/gcs)

**Note:** GCS backend supports the state file lock without extra resources unlike AWS S3 bucket.

Refine your configurations:

- Refine `base` configuration by moving local state to a cloud storage bucket.
- Refine `compute` configuration by moving local state to a cloud storage bucket.

Do not forget to change the path to the remote state for `compute` configuration.

Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your modules valid and fits to a canonical format and style.
Run `terraform plan` to see your changes and re-apply your changes if needed.

## TASK 12 - Import resources

Learn about the [terraform import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/import/index.html) command.

You are going to import a new resource (Cloud Storage Bucket) to your state.
Hint: Keep in mind that there are 3 instances: GCP resource, Terraform state file which store some state of that resource, and Terraform configuration which describe resource. "Importing a resource" is importing its attributes into a Terraform state. Then you have to add said resource to the destination configuration (this action is not automated).

- Create a IAM Service account in GCP Console (`name="test-import"`).
- Add a new resource `google_service_account` `test_import` to the `compute` configuration.
- Run `terraform plan` to see your changes but do not apply changes.
- Import `test_import` IAM Service account to the `compute` state.
- Run `terraform plan` again to ensure that import was successful.

Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your configuration is valid and fits to a canonical format and style.
If applicable all resources should be labeled with following labels: 
- `Terraform=true`, 
- `Project=epam-tf-lab`.
If applicable all resources should be defined with the provider alias.

- Terraform imported resources with no errors
- GCP resources are NOT changed (check GCP Console)

# Advanced tasks

## TASK 13 - Expose node output with nginx

Ensure that the current directory is  `~/tf-epam-lab/compute`

Change User Data script in the Instance Template as follows:

-   Nginx binary should be installed on instance (`port=80`).
-   Variables INSTANCE_ID and VM_MACHINE_UUID should be defined (see Task 8).
-   Nginx default page should be configured to return the same text as we put previously into a Cloud Storage bucket in Task 8: "This message was generated on instance ${INSTANCE_ID} with the following UUID ${VM_MACHINE_UUID}".
-   Nginx server should be started.

Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your configuration is valid and fits to a canonical format and style. Do this each time before applying your changes.
Run `terraform plan` to see your changes.

Apply your changes when ready.

### Definition of DONE:

- Terraform created infrastructure with no errors
- GCP resources created as expected (check GCP Console)
- Nginx server responds on Loadbalancer's IP Address with expected response 

## TASK 14 - Modules

Learn about [terraform modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/develop/index.html)

Refine your configurations:

- Refine `base` configuration by creating module for VPC related resources: vpc, subnetworks.
- Refine `base` configuration by creating module for firewall rules.
- Refine `base` configuration by creating module for a service account related resources.
- [Optional] Refine `compute` configuration by creating instance groups module.


Store your modules in `~/tf-epam-lab/modules/` subfolders.

Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to check if your modules are valid and fit to a canonical format and style.
Run `terraform plan` to see your changes and re-apply your changes if needed.
